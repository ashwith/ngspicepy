ngspicepy is a python library for ngspice. ngspice is general purpose free and open source circuit simulator. While the simulator is quite powerful, processing data after the simulation isn't straightforward. The plot windows aren't very impressive either. This library's main aim is to provide a set of functions that allow one to run simulations on ngspice and get the data in numpy arrays.
